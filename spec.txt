		GRAVITY DEFENSE

- Categoring game elements

	Actors & World objects :
		Sun
		Planets
		Asteroids

	Constraints :
		Gravity
		Collisions

- Description of this game

This game is a tower defense with gravity, the purpose is to protect the sun attacked by asteroids.
For this reason the player has to create planetes to attract or repulse asteroids, to change their path.
A level of this game is composed in two phases :
	-> the tactic phase, the player can :
		- create planets in orbit around the sun
		- move the planets already created around this orbit
		- upgrade planets with some technologies like shields
		- see where the asteroids will come, and see their path
	-> the action phase, the player can :
		- see the asteroid attack

A cycle of this two phases is called a round, at each end of round, the player earns money.
He can earn more money by destroying the asteroids. The money is used to buy other planets and upgrade them.
At each rounds, the level is harder, the asteroids have more life points, different types.

- Break down each game elements

	How it looks :
		Planets, sun : spheres
		Asteroids : big space rocks

	Behaviour :
		Planets : they can be upgraded by adding a shield on it, they can be moved on the orbit during the tactic phase
		Asteroids : the more life points they have, the less attracted by the gravity they are.
			Asteroid types :
				-> Normal asteroids
				-> Splittable asteroids : When the asteroid looses a life point, it splits into two asteroids of a lower level
				-> UFOs : This spaceships aren't influenced by the gravity, they go straight to the sun

- Actor interactions

	Sun & Planets : planets orbit around the sun
	Sun & Asteroids : the sun attracts asteroids, it looses life points when it collides with them
	Planets & Planets : nothing
	Planets & Asteroids :
		the planets attract asteroids
		-> basic planets : the planet looses life points and the asteroid is destroyed
		-> basic shield planets : the asteroid is destroyed and the shield looses life points
		-> bouncy shield planets : the asteroid bounce on the shield and the shield looses life points
		(if the shield has no life points, the planet become a basic planet,
		 the shield is entirely restored at each end of round)
	Asteroids & Asteroids :
		the asteroids loose life points, if they have no life points, they are destroyed
